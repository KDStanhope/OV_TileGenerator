# OV_TileGenerator
Take square polygons (in shapefile format) as input and generates tile compatible with Trimble OrthoVista


Pretty self-explanatory. Put thie scopt on the same filder as the shapefiles you want to use to generate the .tsp tiles and double click or run in IDLE. 

Nothing fancy. Dirt simple.
